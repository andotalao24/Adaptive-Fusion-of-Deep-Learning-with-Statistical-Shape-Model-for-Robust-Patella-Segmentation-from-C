# Adaptive Fusion of Deep Learning with Statistical Shape Model for Robust Patella Segmentation from CT Images

## Description

The codes for the work "Adaptive Fusion of Deep Learning with Statistical Shape Model for Robust Patella Segmentation from CT Images".
Our work is especially designed for patella segmentation in low-data regimes. Our paper is still under review and the preprint version is available (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4026021). 
The preprint version is subjective to changes.
